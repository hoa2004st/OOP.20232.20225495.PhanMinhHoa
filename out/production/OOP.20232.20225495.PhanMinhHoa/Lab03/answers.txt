- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
I think the advantage of Polymorphism is that: since an object can be considered as its parents, a function can handle objects from different classes (that have the same parents/ancestor)

- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
Objects from different class can have the same methods (of ancestor) that can be overide to fit different classes.

- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
Polymorphism is that a class can be considered as a class or its ancestors classes
Inheritance is that a class inherit all of its parent class' functions and attributes
